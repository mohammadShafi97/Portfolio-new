          Hi, I'm Mohammad Shafi S., a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and
          Engineer from Kollam, Kerala, India. I graduated from TKM College of
          Engineering, one of the most prestigious institutions in the state.
        </p>
        <p>My Journey in Tech</p>
        <p>
          From childhood, I have been fascinated by computers, which led me to
          develop strong technical expertise. My passion for coding is so deep
          that I can't end my day without spending at least two hours coding and
          learning about new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>Skills & Expertise</p>
        <p>
          I specialize in the MERN stack and have a strong foundation in: HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Git,
          GitHub
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond development, I also worked as a Technical Coordinator in a
          company for two years, where I honed my problem-solving and leadership
          skills.
        </p>
        <p>Teaching & Mentorship</p>
        <p>
          I'm also a part-time teacher, and over 100 students have attended my
          coaching for higher secondary education. I love sharing knowledge and
          guiding aspiring developers and students toward success.
